Analyze A/B Test Results- Practical Statistics, Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree

- In this project we used mostly descriptive, but also some inferential, statistics to understand an A/B test on a e-Commerce gathered data. 




#### Purpose of this project ####

For this project, I will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. In this project, a company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
